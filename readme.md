# UVA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to UVA problems I have solved. Most of them are in C++, some in Java and/or Python.

The folder name is the problem ID. Each solution was scaffolded using the `cmpnew` script I have written. You can find it [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/scripts/blob/main/cmpnew).
